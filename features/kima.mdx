title: "AI Debugger â€” Kima"
description: "Kima is an AI-powered debugger integrated into the Foresight API platform. It leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to analyze server logs, providing clear, readable explanations and possible solutions for detected errors. The primary goal is to make error handling accessible to non-technical founders, vibe coders, and developers seeking quick and understandable solutions."

## How It Works

When your application encounters an error and logs it through the Foresight API, Kima processes the log entry and interacts with OpenAI to generate a solution. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Log Submission**: Your server submits a log to Foresight API containing essential details like the server ID, error level, message, and stack trace.
2. **GPT Analysis**: Kima sends a prompt to OpenAI to analyze the error and provide a readable explanation and possible fix.
3. **Log Storage**: The processed log, including the GPT solution, is saved for future reference.
4. **Notifications**: If applicable, users receive an email and a WhatsApp message with a summary of the error and a link to the dashboard.

## Example Log Request (JavaScript)

Below is a sample request to submit an error log to Kima:

<RequestExample>

```javascript javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const submitErrorLog = async (message, error_stack) => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post('/service/logs', {
      api_key: 'your_api_key', //replace with api key
      server_id: 'server_123', //replace with server id
      level: 'error',
      message: message, //get error message from server api call
      stack: error_stack, //get error stack from server api call
      tag: 'user-service', //tag your request
      user_id: 'user_456' //your user id
    });

    console.log('Log processed successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error submitting log');
  }
};
```

</RequestExample>

<CodeGroup>

```javascript javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const submitErrorLog = async (message, error_stack) => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post('/service/logs', {
      api_key: 'your_api_key', //replace with api key
      server_id: 'server_123', //replace with server id
      level: 'error',
      message: message, //get error message from server api call
      stack: error_stack, //get error stack from server api call
      tag: 'user-service', //tag your request
      user_id: 'user_456' //your user id
    });

    console.log('Log processed successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error submitting log');
  }
};
```


``` python
```
