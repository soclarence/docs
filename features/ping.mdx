Foresight API's Ping feature helps you monitor your server's health by periodically pinging your endpoints. If your server becomes unresponsive, Foresight promptly notifies you, ensuring you're always aware of potential downtime.

### ðŸ“˜ How It Works

- This feature periodically sends requests to your ip address and your backend address.
- If a ping fails (due to timeout or error responses), a notification is triggered.
- You can configure the frequency of the pings based on your monitoring needs (minimum interval: 5 minutes).

### ðŸš€ Setting Up the Ping Feature

### Step 1: Add Server & Set Up Ping Configuration

Log in to your Foresight API dashboard and add the endpoint and IP Address you want to monitor under the Ping configuration. ![images/addserver-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif](/images/addserver-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif)

### Step 2: Handling Notifications

If your server becomes unresponsive, Foresight will notify you through the configured channels:

- **Email Notifications**
- **WhatsApp Alerts**

### ðŸ”Ž Monitoring Dashboard

Monitor your pings and check the status of your servers through the Foresight API dashboard.
