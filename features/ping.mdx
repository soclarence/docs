Foresight API's Ping feature helps you monitor your server's health by periodically pinging your endpoints. If your server becomes unresponsive, Foresight promptly notifies you, ensuring you're always aware of potential downtime.

### ðŸ“˜ How It Works

- This feature periodically sends requests to your ip address and your backend address.
- If a ping fails (due to timeout or error responses), a notification is triggered.
- You can configure the frequency of the pings based on your monitoring needs (minimum interval: 5 minutes).

### ðŸš€ Setting Up the Ping Feature

To start using the Ping feature, ensure your server is registered and your monitoring configuration is set.

### Step 1: Add Your Server

When you register your server, you'll receive a unique server ID and an API key.

### Step 2: Set Up Ping Configuration

Log in to your Foresight API dashboard and add the endpoint(s) you want to monitor under the Ping configuration.
