### How it works

You create a custom tag with the foresight-SDK using the tracker package. you get a report daily at 5 pm UTC and another report every week with the cumulative activity of all that happened that week regarding your tags, and finally one report at the end of the month.

## Installation

Install the package using npm:

```bash
npm install foresight-sdk
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn add foresight-sdk
```

## Usage

### TypeScript

```typescript
import tracker from 'foresight-sdk';

// Track an event
try {
  await tracker({
    tag: 'event_name',
    apiKey: 'your_api_key',
    userId: 'user_123'
  });
  console.log('Event tracked successfully');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to track event:', error);
}
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
const tracker = require('foresight-sdk').default;

// Track an event
try {
  await tracker({
    tag: 'event_name',
    apiKey: 'your_api_key',
    userId: 'user_123'
  });
  console.log('Event tracked successfully');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to track event:', error);
}
```

## Reference

### tracker(params)

Sends a tracking event to the Foresight platform.

#### Parameters

`params` - Object with the following properties:

- `tag` (string, required): The name or identifier of the event you want to track
- `apiKey` (string, required): Your Foresight API key
- `userId` (string, required): The identifier of the user performing the action

#### Returns

Returns a Promise that resolves when the event is successfully tracked, or rejects with an error if the tracking fails.

## Error Handling

The SDK includes built-in error handling and will throw an error if:

- The request to the Foresight API fails
- Required parameters are missing or invalid
- Network connectivity issues occur

It's recommended to wrap the tracker calls in try-catch blocks to handle potential errors gracefully.
