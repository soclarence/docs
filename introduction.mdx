title: "Welcome to Foresight API"
description: "Foresight API is a lightweight server monitoring tool built to help non-technical founders know what's up with their server. Is it asleep? is it Dead? was there a payment failure? why? We believe server errors and failed transactions and all the other things that happens on the backend should be clear enough and understood but just anyone. With Foresight API, you have a tool that send pings to your server to know if it is live, you also have a tool that converts unreadable server errors to GPT explained problems with suggestions on how to fix them."
